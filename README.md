# Installer for a Lumberjack site with Bedrock

## Usage

Install this package globally via Composer:

```
composer global require rareloop/lumberjack-bedrock-installer
```

You can then scaffold out a new Lumberjack/Bedrock site using:

```
lumberjack-bedrock new my-site
```

The above command will create a folder in your current directory called `my-site` which contains Bedrock with Lumberjack ready to go.

## Bleeding Edge

If you like to use the latest development commits for Bedrock & Lumberjack Theme instead of the most recent stable releases, you can add the `--dev` flag.

```
lumberjack-bedrock new my-site --dev
```
